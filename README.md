# CRC32
The CRC32 program can be used to detect accidental errors in transmitted or stored data. 
By using a checksum, you can check whether the data you sent has not been corrupted during transmission or storage.
Use CRC32 when you want to verify data integrity. 
Calculate the checksum before and after transmitting the data, and then verify that the data is the same and has not been modified.
